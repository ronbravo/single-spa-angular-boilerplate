# Single SPA Boilerplate

This project was build with the [Single SPA Boilerplate](https://github.com/ronbravo/single-spa-boilerplate) repo. A set of boilerplate configurations for working with the [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/) framework. The boilerplates are broken out into separate branches with a desire to keep them as minimal as possible. Each branch should have it's own `README.md` file with specific instructions for working with that particular setup.

**NOTE:** You may want to replace the information in the `package.json` with the appropriate information about the maintaining organization or company.
